                            2 States: The Story of My Marriage is autobiographical with only names changed. The story is about a couple Krish and Ananya, who hail from two states of India, Punjab and Tamil Nadu, respectively, who are deeply in love and want to marry. It is narrated from a first-person point of view in a humorous tone, often taking digs at both Tamil and Punjabi cultures.

                            The story begins in the IIM Ahmedabad mess hall where Krish, a Punjabi boy from Delhi sights a beautiful girl Ananya, a Tamilian from Chennai quarreling with the mess staff about the food. Ananya was tagged as the "Best girl of the fresher batch". They become friends within a few days. Both graduate and get jobs with serious plans for their wedding.
                        </p>
                        <p>  At first, Krish tries to convince his girlfriend Ananya's parents by helping Ananya's brother Manju IIT tuition and by helping her father Swaminathan create his first PowerPoint presentation. He later convinces her mom by helping her fulfill her biggest dream of singing at a concert by arranging for her to perform at the concert organised by Krish's employer City Bank.</p>

                            Hannah is left to navigate the aftermath when her husband Owen disappears during an embezzlement investigation. He leaves a note begging Hannah to protect Bailey, her teenage stepdaughter. Bailey is often difficult towards Hannah, but after finding a duffel bag from Owen with $600,000 in cash, she depends on Hannah for answers. The FBI begins to investigate, and Hannah learns Owen is hiding his true identity.

                            Hannah remembers Owen's defensiveness when she suggested they go to Texas for vacation, and Bailey recalls some early memories from there, leading to their departure from California to Texas.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In Austin, his old Professor recalls him and gives them access to old class photos. They discover a picture of a woman, Kate Smith, who looks nearly identical to Bailey. After doing some research, Hannah connects Kate to a bar nearby. She heads over, hiding Bailey in a cafe. Hannah speaks to the bartender, Charlie, gleaning bits of information about the woman—his sister—who has since died. Trying to connect them to Owen, she shows him a picture. Charlie reacts violently, throwing Hannah's phone to the floor. Bailey bursts in and orders him to back away. He freezes in a state of shock, identifying Bailey as Kristin. They return to their hotel to hide and pack for a flight home.

                        A warm, incisive new novel about the enduring bonds of marriage and friendship from Cynthia D’Aprix Sweeney, author of the instant New York Times bestseller The Nest

                        Flora Mancini has been happily married for more than twenty years. But everything she thought she knew about herself, her marriage, and her relationship with her best friend, Margot, is upended when she stumbles upon an envelope containing her husband’s wedding ring—the one he claimed he lost one summer when their daughter, Ruby, was five.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Flora and Julian struggled for years, scraping together just enough acting work to raise Ruby in Manhattan and keep Julian’s small theater company—Good Company—afloat. A move to Los Angeles brought their first real career successes, a chance to breathe easier, and a reunion with Margot, now a bona fide television star. But has their new life been built on lies? What happened that summer all those years ago? And what happens now?
